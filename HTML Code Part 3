        <h3>Game Design</h3>
            <p id="intro">I hope people enjoy the game I am designing. I am very new to computer coding and programming so my final
            project and game will not be as fluid or complex as that of a more experienced computer programmer.  This is the first
            serious computer programming and coding class I have taken and it we learned how to code in and use C, HTML, CSS, PHP
            MYSQL and finally we learned about JavaScript.</p>
            <p>The final project I am proposing to work on and complete will mainly utilize elements of HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript
            with maybe jQuery thrown in there to make it more interesting and user friendly.  This is because these four computer
            languages are more user-friendly than C and are not rigid or literal in their logic and are more open to interpretation.</p>
            <p>In the game that will be entered as my final project, the user will be asked to create a list of daily tasks and chores,
            to be completed each or just for that day.  The program will allow the user to modify their list, by either increasing or 
            decreasing the number of tasks they are to complete.  The user will also be able to check off completed tasks and keep track
            of the number of chores they have finished.  At the end of the day after entering in their name and password, the user will 
            be able to see how many points they have earned, their total number of tasks, how many tasks they completed for that day
            and how many uncompleted tasks & chores they have left.</p>
