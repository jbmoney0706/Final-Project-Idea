This is one boring game I am designing.
Pretty simple and not that entertaining
Need to find some pictures and add some color using CSS to make it dynamic and user friendly.
I have my list.
I know how to ask for the name of the user.
Say how many tasks they have on their list.
How many chores they have completed.
And how many they have left to accomplish.
Need to fix vmware player so that I can actually run my program.
Need to fix the internet connection to it so I can update my appliance.
